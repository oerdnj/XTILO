# Turing Machine Implementation

A simple implementation of Turing Machine in C++.  It implements "infinite" tape
in both directions - if the current head position goes outside of the tape
dimensions, the tape is expanded in that direction (in very inefficient manner
though).

The State class also implements Iterator pattern for the list of the
States.

## Compile

This projects uses Meson build system and is written in C++17 and can be built
as follows:

```
meson setup builddir
cd builddir
ninja
```

## Syntax

## Syntax for writing your own program for Turing simulator

This Turing Machine can run the examples from: http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html, so their syntax directly matches ours.

* Each line should contain one tuple of the form `<current state> <current symbol> <new symbol> <direction> <new state>`.
* You can use any number or word for `<current state>` and `<new state>`, eg. `10`, `a`, `state1`. State labels are case-sensitive.
* You can use almost any character for `<current symbol>` and `<new symbol>`, or `_` to represent blank (space). Symbols are case-sensitive.
* You can't use `;`, `*`, `_` or whitespace as symbols.
* `<direction>` should be `l`, `r` or `*`, denoting 'move left', 'move right' or 'do not move', respectively.
* Anything after a `;` is a comment and is ignored.
* The machine halts when it reaches any state starting with 'halt', eg. halt, halt-accept.

## Run

```
./tm <tape> <inputfile>
```

Tape can contain `_` or ` ` (space) to represent blank (space).
